# Amazing Pyrime
## Project Overview
Amazing Pyrime has hired us to perform analysis on movie data; We've been tasked with creating an automated ETL pipeline for JSON and CSV files. 

### Purpose
Create functions that take in Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, then perform cleaning and add its data to a PostgreSQL database.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main difficulty of this project was working with large (200 MB- 1 GB) files since anytime we want to test the function, we have to wait a few minutes for it to process. 

## Summary
We've successfully created the movie analysis pipeline and can now query these databases using PostgreSQL.
